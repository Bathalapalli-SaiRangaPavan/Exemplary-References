```terraform init```: Initializes the working directory containing Terraform configuration files. This command downloads the necessary plugins/modules defined in the configuration.

```terraform validate```: Checks the syntax and configuration of the Terraform files to ensure they are properly formatted and valid.

```terraform plan```: Creates an execution plan. It shows what actions Terraform will take to create the infrastructure described in the configuration files.

```terraform apply```: Executes the actions proposed in the execution plan generated by terraform plan. It creates or modifies the resources as defined in the configuration.

```terraform destroy```: Destroys all the resources defined in the configuration. It's like a reverse of terraform apply, tearing down the infrastructure that was created.
