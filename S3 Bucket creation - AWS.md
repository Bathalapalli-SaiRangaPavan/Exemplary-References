## Steps

1. **Sign in to AWS Management Console**: Go to [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/) and sign in to your AWS account using your credentials.

2. **Navigate to S3**: Once logged in, navigate to the S3 service by either searching for "S3" in the AWS services search bar or by selecting it from the storage section in the console.

3. **Create Bucket**:
   - Click on the "Create bucket" button.
   - Provide a globally unique name for your bucket (e.g., my-example-bucket).
   - Choose a region where you want to create the bucket (e.g., US East (N. Virginia)).
   - Click "Create".

4. **Set Permissions** (Optional):
   - You can specify permissions for the bucket using bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs). For simplicity, you can leave the permissions as default (private) for this lab setup.

5. **Review**:
   - Review the bucket configuration to ensure everything is set up correctly.
   - If everything looks good, click "Create bucket" to create the bucket.

6. **Bucket Created**:
   - Once the bucket is created, you will see a confirmation message. You can now start using the bucket to store objects.
