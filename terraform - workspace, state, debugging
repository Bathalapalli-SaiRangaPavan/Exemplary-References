Workspaces
-----------
Now what workspaces do is they effectively give us a way to split up a state file. It's a way of us logically separating the statefiles.

# to see my workspaces 
- terraform workspace list 

# to create a workspace & it creates a new statefile 
- terraform workspace new dev

- terraform plan # u can see 2 resources to create 

# to see workspace you are in 
- terraform workspace show 

# to swap into other workspace 
- terraform workspace list 
u get default, dev now ur currently in the dev workspace 
# now i want to go to default workspace 
- terraform worspace select default 

# delete the workspace created (dev) 
- terraform workspace delete dev


state commands 
---------------
statefile - state is the ultimate truth. if any issues with statefile it causes lot of pain 
# to see the resources currently inside 
- terraform state list 

# to see what ur statefile contained 
- terraform state pull 

# to rename the resources inside the statefile
- terraform state mv aws_vpc.myvpc2 aws_vpc.my2ndvpc

#we can also pass the command for backup before we make any change 
- terraform state mv aws_vpc.myvpc2 aws_vpc.my2ndvpc -backup-out=<give path>>

# delete the resource from statefile 
- terraform state rm aws_vpc.my2ndvpc 

Debugging commands
---------------------
mac/linux 
# The most verbose logging can set is 
- export TF_LOG=TRACE
